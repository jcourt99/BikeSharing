# BikeSharing
Module 14 - Tableau

## Overview

This analysis is needed to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a good business proposal. Data is used from a similar bike-sharing program called "Citi Bike" in New York City in order to create a presentation to the investors.

## Results

The seven visualizations below were created in Tableau to present to the investors:

### 1. Top Starting Locations

This image represents the areas which are the most popular starting locations for the bike rides. Manhattan has the greatest number of bike checkouts. This may be due to the large population and large amount of tourists. 

### 2. August Peak Hours
![August Peak Hours](https://github.com/jcourt99/BikeSharing/blob/main/Images/August%20Peak%20Hours.png)

The peak hours during a high-usage month are 6-7pm and 8am. These peak hours correlate with work hour start and end times. Riders pick up the bikes to go to work and then to go home from work.

### 3. Duration of Bike Trips
![Duration of Bike Usage](https://github.com/jcourt99/BikeSharing/blob/main/Images/User%20Checkout%20Times.png) 

The duration of the bike checkout times peak between 4-6 hours in length. Some bikes are checked out for as long as 23 hours.

### 4. Duration of Trips by Gender
![Duration of Trips by Gender](https://github.com/jcourt99/BikeSharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)

The length of bike trips varies by gender. More men had the bikes checked out from 4-6 hours.While females had bikes checked out for 3-10 hours with a less defined peak than the males.

### 5. User Trips by Weekday
![Trips by Weekday](https://github.com/jcourt99/BikeSharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Weekday.png)

This heatmap shows the busiest hours per day when bikes were returned by users. Weekday morning and evenings are the busiest times. Weekends have steady usage during the hours of 9am to 6pm. 

### 6. User trips by Gender and Weekday
![Trips by Gender](https://github.com/jcourt99/BikeSharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Gender.png)

Men take the majority of the trips every day when compared to female usage of bikes. Both genders use the bikes most frequently at the start and end of the work day, Monday through Friday. 

### 7. Trips by User Type and Gender
![Trips by User Type](https://github.com/jcourt99/BikeSharing/blob/main/Images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender.png)

Male subscribers take more trips than anyone else. More female subscribers use the bikes than regular customers. This heatmap verifies that the subscribers are the most frequent users of the bike program.


## Summary

This bike-sharing analysis provided detailed information about the New York City program. Bikes are checked out all day long, but peak at the start and end of the work day. Riders who purchase a subscription for the bike program are more likely to use the bikes. Men use the bikes more often than women and tend to check out the bikes for a longer duration of time.

For future analysis, I would recommend incorporating the cost of the subscription membership and the cost of the bike rental for non-subscribers.
